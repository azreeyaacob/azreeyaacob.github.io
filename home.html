    <h2>Personal Background</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Azree Yaacob, and this website is a look into my professional journey and academic pursuits. I currently work as a IT Security Governance Officer at FGV Holdings Berhad, dedicating my weekdays to protecting critical systems and data. Even while fully immersed in the corporate world, my passion for continuous learning drives me. In parallel with my professional role, I am actively pursuing my dream of obtaining my first degree in Information System Management at Mara Technology University (UiTM). This personal website was primarily developed as part of my university assignment, but I also see it as a valuable platform to share insights and showcase my work. I hope you find the information here useful and informative!</p>
